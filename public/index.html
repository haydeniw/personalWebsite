     I care deeply about design, diversity, and solving tough problems with collaboration and teamwork. I am proud of my transgender identity and if you are LGBTQ+ and in tech please reach out to me! This year I'm trying to meditate 200 minutes each month. In the next few years, I would like to work on training a small autonomous vehicle. creating a small autonomous vehicle. I accidentally programmed IBM's Quantum Computer in high school, have read multiple books about typefaces, and for a period of time my dog knew the sound of a Waymo autonomous vehicle. I like to cook, read books, and work out in my free time.
